## Reminders

* Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
* Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
* Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Introduction
<hr>
Welcome to the Speed Typing Game. A game with educational purpose, for anyone who aims to become a faster typer, but also just for the fun of it. Type as many of the 6-letter words that are shown, as you can, in 60 seconds. There is a direct feedbackloop when the letters are typed, through colouring of the letters, either red or green. When you have finished you can get your score by email or try again immediately. But be careful, it's addictive! This game is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
